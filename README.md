# HillClimbingAlgorithim

Within a randomly generated 2D matrix with plateus created by our
Professor we were tasked with finding the peak while only being able
to view 4 cells in any direction in as few movements as possible.
When out of bounds coordinates would be represented by -1.

I used my alogrithim to find the slope of the mountain and would
move in that direction, but during the beginning of a new simulation
my algorithim would take much larger movements in that direction in
order to increase efficiency. During plateus I would jump to a
coordinate within the matrix that I knew to be within bounds.
